## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of numerical methods for evaluating the **acoustic Green’s function** in a half-space with impedance boundary conditions.

The computational strategy is based on **Gauss-Legendre**, **Gauss-Laguerre**, and **hybrid quadrature** techniques designed for highly accurate and efficient numerical integration.

These methods support theoretical findings presented in the corresponding Master’s Thesis.
